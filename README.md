--This is my first step into becoming a web developer, to start, the page will have no CSS or scripts, so it will look a bit too 'brutalist'

--3 pages completed after a bit more than an hour. I believe to have cemented the following skills:
-Creating simple HTML pages with headings, paragraphs, pictures, ordered and unordered lists.
-How to use the clone, add, commit -m, status, log and push functions of Git. 

--What I can improve on what was done:
-Git commit messages had typos and two of the subjects were not capitalized 
-Though I didn't study in detail yet, I'm almost sure that my identation/nesting was also poorly made, maybe I could have saved a few lines
-No comments were added to this code, though it is only for me, it's a good practice to have.
